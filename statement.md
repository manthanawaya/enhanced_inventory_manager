PROJECT STATEMENT AND SCOPE

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many small businesses or individuals need a simple, reliable method to track their physical or digital inventory without investing in complex enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The lack of a structured system leads to inaccurate stock counts, miscalculated asset values, and difficulty in making timely restocking decisions.

------------------------------------------------------

2. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The project scope is limited to a console-based interface managing a single inventory list stored locally in a JSON file. It covers all basic inventory operations (CRUD) and provides a quantitative summary report. Out of scope are complex features such as multi-user access, dedicated database integration (e.g., SQL), network connectivity, or advanced data visualization.
